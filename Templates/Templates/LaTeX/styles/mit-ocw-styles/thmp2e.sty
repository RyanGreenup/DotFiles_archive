% LaTeX2e style file for theorem and proof environments, by Glenn Tesler
% usage: add thmp2e as an option to whatever documentstyle you're using
%               \usepackage{mathp2e, thmp2e}

% This style file adds the following commands.
%       * New theorem environments.
%           \begin{theorem} ... \end{theorem}
%           \begin{theorem}[Theorem Name] ... \end{theorem}
%         These produce a theorem heading and number, and italicize the
%         enclosed text.  The word "theorem" may be replaced by any of
%               axiom conjecture corollary lemma
%               property proposition question theorem
%         and these will all be numbered in the same numbering sequence.
%         The components of the numbers are separated by dashes instead
%         of periods.
%         The heading and number are boldfaced, but the remark is not.
%
%       * New definition/remark environments.
%           \begin{definition} ... \end{definition}
%           \begin{definition}[Comment] ... \end{definition}
%         These are similar to the theorem environments.  The word
%         ``Definition'' is set in italics, and the definition nubmer,
%         optional comment, and text are in roman.  The word ``definition''
%         may be replaced by ``example'' or``remark'' and similar
%         environments may be defined via
%                               \newdef{bar}{Bar}
%         When activated via
%           \begin{bar} ... \end{bar}
%           \begin{bar}[Comment] ... \end{bar}
%         the heading will be ``Bar'' instead of ``Definition''.
%
%       * New proof environments.
%         \begin{proof} ... \end{proof}
%         This produces a proof heading, and vertical space around the proof.
%         By default, every proof ends with a Halmos box at the right margin, 
%         If there isn't room for the box on the last line of text, it
%         will appear at the right margin of the next line.
%         The $\box$ may be replaced with another symbol; for example,
%         to use a $\triangleleft$, issue the following command
%                       \useHalmos{$\triangleleft$}
%         If the proof ends in a display, then issue the command
%         \qedhere to move the box to the end of the display.
%         The word ``proof'' may be replaced by ``solution'' and similar
%	  environments may be defined via
%	                      \newproof{foop}{Foop}
%         When activated via
%          \begin{foop} ... \end{foop}
%         the heading will be ``Foop'' instead of ``Proof''.
%       * New citation macro
%         To facilitate puting citations in theorem/definition remarks,
%               \citep{pages}{source}
%         is similar to
%               \cite[pages]{source}
%         but lacks the square brackets, so that nested square brackets don't
%         confuse LaTeX.

%       Patch to latex.tex to make headings for theorems end in         %

% Headings for theorems should end in periods, and should have ordinary

% Change Log:
%
%       gptesler 1/26/94: topsep changed in proof and theorem environments
%       tmack    6/99:    package renamed to thmp2e.sty
%                         added in \usepackage{latexsym} before \Box command
%                         replaced \em with the latex2e \emph command; other
%                               font declarations unchanged
%                         command \citep{pages}{source} added to avoid 
%                               nested square brackets
%                         commented-out code removed
%       slkleiman 9/99:   added command \useHalmos#1
%       slkleiman 2/05:   made \useHalmos{$\Box$} the default
%       slkleiman 10/05:  defined \qedhere
%                         redefined the proof environment to accept \qedhere
%       slkleiman 12/05:  added code to undefine in \newdef
%       slkleiman 2/06:   added \newproof#1#2 and \newproof{solution}{Solution}
