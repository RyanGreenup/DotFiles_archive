The subjects, classified as novices or experienced, based on programming experience, were asked to locate and fix a single logical bug in small segments of C code. Two different tasks – searching a linked list and copying a linked list, were used in the experiment. Statistical analyses yielded the following significant results: (i) 63.2\% of all subjects located the bug in the recursive constructs compared to 41.5\% for the iterative constructs (p{$<$}.00001); (ii) Grouped by task, and level of programmer experience, there were significantly more correct responses for the recursive code than for the iterative code (p{$<$}.02 in all four groupings); (iii) In terms of locating and fixing the bug, more responses were correct for the recursive version of the copy task than for the iterative version (p=.01875). Results of a t-test procedure showed no significant difference between the iterative and recursive constructs in terms of mean times needed for successful completion of the debugging tasks.},

A design based on generic functions and a rich type system simultaneously enables an expressive programming model and successful type inference, leading to good performance for a wide range of programs.

The widely-used Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) method is tested on a sample of around 12,600 satellite images for statistical analysis. The core of the new water classification method is the use of a water probability algorithm based on the stacking of repeat measurements, which can mitigate the effects of translational offsets of images and the classification errors caused by clouds and cloud shadows. By integrating QuickBird, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 multispectral images, the final data product provides a 2 m resolution coastline, as well as a 2 m water probability map and a repeat-count measurement map. Improvements on the existing coastline (GSHHS-the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database, 50 m–5000 m) in terms of resolution (2 m) is substantial, thanks to the combination of multiple data sources.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, a fractal is a self-similar subset of Euclidean space whose fractal dimension strictly exceeds its topological dimension. Fractals appear the same at different levels, as illustrated in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales called self-similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry; if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge, it is called affine self-similar.  Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of measure theory. One way that fractals are different from finite geometric figures is the way in which they scale. Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). However, if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power that is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal, and it usually exceeds the fractal's topological dimension.Analytically, fractals are usually nowhere differentiable. An infinite fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line – although it is still 1-dimensional, its fractal dimension indicates that it also resembles a surface. Starting in the 17th century with notions of recursion, fractals have moved through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment of the concept to the study of continuous but not differentiable functions in the 19th century by the seminal work of Bernard Bolzano, Bernhard Riemann, and Karl Weierstrass, and on to the coining of the word fractal in the 20th century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based modelling in the 20th century. The term "fractal" was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975. Mandelbrot based it on the Latin frāctus, meaning "broken" or "fractured", and used it to extend the concept of theoretical fractional dimensions to geometric patterns in nature.There is some disagreement among mathematicians about how the concept of a fractal should be formally defined. Mandelbrot himself summarized it as "beautiful, damn hard, increasingly useful. That's fractals." More formally, in 1982 Mandelbrot stated that "A fractal is by definition a set for which the Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension." Later, seeing this as too restrictive, he simplified and expanded the definition to: "A fractal is a shape made of parts similar to the whole in some way." Still later, Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language: "...to use fractal without a pedantic definition, to use fractal dimension as a generic term applicable to all the variants".The consensus is that theoretical fractals are infinitely self-similar, iterated, and detailed mathematical constructs having fractal dimensions, of which many examples have been formulated and studied in great depth. Fractals are not limited to geometric patterns, but can also describe processes in time. Fractal patterns with various degrees of self-similarity have been rendered or studied in images, structures and sounds and found in nature, technology, art, architecture and law. Fractals are of particular relevance in the field of chaos theory, since the graphs of most chaotic processes are fractals.},

  abstract = {This textbook introduces the vast array of features and powerful mathematical functions of Mathematica using a multitude of clearly presented examples and worked-out problems. Each section starts with a description of a new topic and some basic examples. The author then demonstrates the use of new commands through three categories of problems - the first category highlights those essential parts of the text that demonstrate the use of new commands in Mathematica whilst solving each problem presented; - the second comprises problems that further demonstrate the use of commands previously introduced to tackle different situations; and - the third presents more challenging problems for further study. The intention is to enable the reader to learn from the codes, thus avoiding long and exhausting explanations. While based on a computer algebra course taught to undergraduate students of mathematics, science, engineering and finance, the book also includes chapters on calculus and solving equations, and graphics, thus covering all the basic topics in Mathematica. With its strong focus upon programming and problem solving, and an emphasis on using numerical problems that do not need any particular background in mathematics, this book is also ideal for self-study and as an introduction to researchers who wish to use Mathematica as a computational tool. This new edition has been extensively revised and updated, and includes new chapters with problems and worked examples},

With the advent of large digitized databases, it has become possible to examine in detail large regions of coast and to examine differences in complexity, as measured by the fractal dimension, among regions. In this study, we have determined the fractal dimension of the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines of the conterminous United States. The traditional divider method was used in obtaining the fractal dimension of each coastline arc from the NOAA Medium-Resolution Shoreline Data Set. On average, the Atlantic coast has much higher fractal dimension than the Pacific coast. The results also indicate that the complexity of the Atlantic coast increases toward low latitudes. These results have implications for the interpretation of species distributions and diversity patterns along the coast and for the understanding of the dynamics of biotic recovery from mass extinctions.},

Thus the behavior of the function on the Fatou set is "regular", while on the Julia set its behavior is "chaotic". The Julia set of a function f is commonly denoted J(f), and the Fatou set is denoted F(f).

  abstract = {Measurement of graph centrality provides us with an indication of the importance or popularity of each vertex in a graph. When dealing with graphs that are not centrally controlled (such as the Web, social networks and academic citation graphs), centrality measure must 1) correlate with vertex importance/popularity, 2) scale well in terms of computation, and 3) be difficult to manipulate by individuals. The Random Surfer probability transition model, combined with Eigenvalue Centrality produced PageRank, which has shown to satisfy the required properties. Existing centrality measures (including PageRank) make the assumption that all directed edges are positive, implying an endorsement. Recent work on sentiment analysis has shown that this assumption is not valid. In this article, we introduce a new method of transitioning a graph, called Power Walk, that can successfully compute centrality scores for graphs with real weighted edges. We show that it satisfies the desired properties, and that its computation time and centrality ranking is similar to when using the Random Surfer model for non-negative matrices. Finally, stability and convergence analysis shows us that both stability and convergence when using the power method, are dependent on the Power Walk parameter β.},

Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com/ Brought to you by you: https://3b1b.co/fractals-thanks And by Affirm: https://www.affirm.com/careers Music by Vince Rubinetti: https://soundcloud.com/vincerubinetti... One technical note: It's possible to have fractals with an integer dimension.  The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2.  Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!). The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose "Hausdorff dimension" is greater than its "topological dimension".  Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe.   Topological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc.  For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262.  A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension  2.3.  And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer. See Mandelbrot's book "The Fractal Geometry of Nature" for the full details and more examples. ------------------ 3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

In the present paper, the concept of factorials has been generalised as applicable to real and imaginary numbers, and multifactorials. New functions based on Euler’s factorial function have been proposed for the factorials of real negative and imaginary numbers. As per the present concept, the factorials of real negative numbers, are complex numbers. The factorials of real negative integers have their imaginary part equal to zero, thus are real numbers. Similarly, the factorials of imaginary numbers are complex numbers. The moduli of the complex factorials of real negative numbers, and imaginary numbers are equal to their respective real positive number factorials. Fractional factorials and multifactorials have been defined in a new perspective. The proposed concept has also been extended to Euler’s gamma function for real negative numbers and imaginary numbers, and beta function.},

  abstract = {Technological systems become organized by commands from outside, as when human intentions lead to the building of structures or machines. But many nat­ ural systems become structured by their own internal processes: these are the self­ organizing systems, and the emergence of order within them is a complex phe­ nomenon that intrigues scientists from all disciplines. Unfortunately, complexity is ill-defined. Global explanatory constructs, such as cybernetics or general sys­ tems theory, which were intended to cope with complexity, produced instead a grandiosity that has now, mercifully, run its course and died. Most of us have become wary of proposals for an "integrated, systems approach" to complex matters; yet we must come to grips with complexity some­ how. Now is a good time to reexamine complex systems to determine whether or not various scientific specialties can discover common principles or properties in them. If they do, then a fresh, multidisciplinary attack on the difficulties would be a valid scientific task. Believing that complexity is a proper scientific issue, and that self-organizing systems are the foremost example, R. Tomovic, Z. Damjanovic, and I arranged a conference (August 26-September 1, 1979) in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, to address self-organizing systems. We invited 30 participants from seven countries. Included were biologists, geologists, physicists, chemists, mathematicians, bio­ physicists, and control engineers. Participants were asked not to bring manu­ scripts, but, rather, to present positions on an assigned topic. Any writing would be done after the conference, when the writers could benefit from their experi­ ences there.},

  abstract = {Extreme storm events and their consequent shoreline changes are of great importance for understanding coastal evolution and assessing storm hazards. This work investigates the fractal properties of the spatial distributions of shoreline changes caused by storms. Wavelet analysis and upper-truncated power law (UTPL) fitting are used to study the power spectra of shoreline changes and to evaluate the upper limits of the cross-shore erosion and accretion. During a period affected by storms, the alongshore shoreline change patterns are strong on the 15\,km scale but are weak with lower spectral power on the 20\,km scale. The areas adjacent to the eroded shoreline are usually accrete, and the cross-shore extent of erosion is larger than that of accretion when the coast is affected by storms. The fractal properties of shoreline changes due to storms are found to be temporally continuous: the effects of later storms build on the preceding shoreline conditions, including both the effects of previous storms and the subsequent shoreline recoveries. This work provides a new perspective on the various scales of the spatial variations of the morphodynamics of storm-affected shorelines.},

The fractal concept was presented for the first time in that paper and has been applied to many fields ever since. According to the fractal theory and conditions of fractal research of coastline, the controls of faults and biologic function on the fractal character of coastline are preliminarily discussed on the basis of GIS in this paper. Finally, some significant conclusions are drawn: 1) the faults control the basic trends of coastlines of two study areas; 2) the fractal dimension of coastline of Taiwan is smaller than that of Changle — Lufeng, because the faults of Taiwan more intensely control the trend and fractal dimension of the coastline; 3) the larger the fractal dimension of the faults or the major faults, the more the controlling effect of them on the trend and fractal dimension of coastline; 4) the larger fractal dimension of the coastline of Changle — Lufeng indicates that the biologic function intensely shapes the coastline. In a word, the controls of faults and biologic function on the fractal character of coastline are discussed with a case study of China in this paper, it can be seen that faults and biologic function both have influence over the trend and fractal dimension of coastline, the fractal mechanism of coastline of two study areas may be so.},
