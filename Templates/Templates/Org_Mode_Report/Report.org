* TODO Introduction
Fractals are complex shapes that often occur from natural processes, in this
report we hope to investigate the emergence of patterns and complex structures
from natural phenomena. We begin with an investigation into fractals and the
concept of dimension and then discuss links between fractal patterns and natural
processes.

** A note on Images in this report
Although the images in this document may appear to be quite small, they are high quality PNG images and one of the luxuries of PDF is that the embedded media is near lossless, so to perceive greater detail in an image it is sufficient to simply zoom in and the greater detail should be rendered. [fn:: Apparently it's also possible to embed live GIFs into PDF as well which would have been nice to do had time permitted, see for example the ~Animate~ package for \LaTeX cite:CTANPackageAnimate and [[https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5396/is-there-any-way-to-include-an-animated-gif-directly][this discussion]] cite:PdftexThereAny generally.]

** Definition of a Fractal                                                     :Ryan:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: definition
:END:

Benoît Mandelbrot coined the term fractal in 1975
cite:gomoryBenoitMandelbrot19242010 and defined it in his 1982 book /The Fractal
Geometry of Nature/ [[cite:mandelbrotFractalGeometryNature1982][p. 15]] :

#+begin_quote
/A fractal is by definition a set for which the Hausdorff Besicovitch dimension
strictly exceeds the topological dimension./

/Every set with a non-integer \(D\) is a fractal./ [fn:qt]
#+end_quote

The topological dimension is strictly an integer value that describes the
natural dimension used to describe a shape
cite:sandersonFractalsAreTypically2017, for example the /Koch Snowflake/ (shown
in Figure [[koch-snowflake]]) is composed of just a line, so it's topological
dimension would simply be 1, it's /fractal dimension/ however is shown to be
\(\frac{\ln\left( 4 \right)}{\ln\left( 3 \right)}\) at eqref:eq:koch-dim in
\S[[#topological-equivalence]].

Many authors seem to accept this earlier definition (see e.g. [[cite:vicsekFractalGrowthPhenomena1992][\S2.2]] and [[cite:telChaoticDynamicsIntroduction2006][\S2.1]]),
this definition however does not capture many edge-case fractals
 [[cite:edgarMeasureTopologyFractal2008a][VII]] and in reprinting of /The
Fractal Geometry of Nature/ Mandelbrot himself commented that in hindsight it
may have been more appropriate [[cite:mandelbrotFractalGeometryNature1982][p. 459]]:

#+begin_quote
/to leave the term "fractal” without a pedantic definition, to use “fractal dimension” as a generic term applicable to all the variants in Chapter 39, and to use in each specific case whichever definition is the most appropriate/.
#+end_quote

Gerald Edgar, in his 2008 book /Measure, topology, and fractal geometry/
rejected this view because "/a term without a 'pedantic definition' cannot be
studied mathematically/" [[cite:edgarMeasureTopologyFractal2008a][VII]] and
presented a more robust definition in Ch. 6 of that book, it was however
accepted that the loose definition of fractal dimension is convenient and was
indeed adopted in that work.

Although reviewing the precise definition of a fractal would have been very
interesting, without a cursory knowledge of fractals generally this would have
been very time consuming and outside the scope of this report [fn:: Mandelbrot
also discussed fractals of a Euclidean and Reimannian nature,
[[cite:mandelbrotFractalGeometryNature1982][p. 361]], this again is interesting
but too specific for the broad nature of our investigation].

Some authors simply define a fractal as a shape that /shows irregularities at
all scales/ [[cite:gouyetPhysicsFractalStructures1996][p. 1]] and in his 2003
book, /Fractal Geometry/, Falconer suggested that it is more convenient to
describe a fractal by a list of properties characteristic of such shapes [fn::
Much like the definition of life in the field of biology] because of the
difficulty in defining a fractal in a way that can encompass all edge cases and
provides the following characteristics
[[cite:falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b][p. xxv]]:

    - Detail at all scales
    - Cannot be described in a traditional geometric way
    - May have some form of approximate self similarity
    - Usually the fractal dimension is greater than its topological dimension
    - In many cases defined very simply, perhaps recursively

This will be the approach adopted in this report.

It's interesting to note that many authors refer to complex natural shapes as
fractals, such as coastlines (see e.g.
cite:jiangFractalAnalysisComplexity1998,zhuFractalMechanismCoastline2002,zhongFractalPropertiesShoreline2017)
much in the spirit of Mandelbrot's paper /How long is the Coastline of Britain/
cite:mandelbrotHowLongCoast1967, although he coined the term fractal many years
after this paper, presumably he might have had this in mind [fn:: Mandelbrot also
spent much time looking at the roughness of financial markets and so presumably
may have had that in mind as well, see e.g.
cite:gomoryBenoitMandelbrot19242010,mandelbrotMisBehaviourMarkets2008 ] when
framing the definition so this issue in clearly defining what a fractal is
appears on the surface to be a purely mathematical one (as opposed to a
practical or applied one).

The Wikipedia page on fractals cite:Fractal2020 also points out that a
fractal is nowhere differentiable, this would be because a fractal is
nowhere smooth, which is certainly an important and distinguishing feature worth noting.

** Fractals Generally                                                          :James:
Dimension is the main defining property of a fractal. As aforementioned above, the Hausdorff dimension is a unique number in that, if we take some shape in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and the Hausdorff dimension converges to some number, then the dimension of the shape is given by that number. Otherwise, it will equal $0$ or $\infty$. For example, if we want to evaluate the dimension of a square and we use a 1-Dimensional shape as the cover set to calculate the Hausdorff dimension, we will get $\infty$. On the other hand, if we do the same with a 3-Dimensional shape, we will get 0. And finally if we use a 2-Dimensional shape, the Hausdorff dimension will evaluate to 2. This same notion is important when computing the dimension of a more complex shape such as the Koch snowflake.

To define a fractal, we must define it's dimension. Whilst some research states that a fractal has a non-integer dimension, this is not true for all fractals. Although, most fractals like the Koch snowflake do in fact have non-integer dimensions, we can easily find a counter example namely, the Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set lies in the same dimension as a square, a 2-Dimensional shape. However, we give recognition to the complexity and roughness of the Mandelbrot set which clearly distinguishes itself from a square. Beneath the Mandelbrot set's complexity are exact replicates of the largest scaled Mandelbrot set, i.e a self similar shape. Furthermore, although the Mandelbrot set has an integer dimension, the self similarity and complexity is what also defines its fractal nature.

** Fractal Dimension                   
The concept of a non-integer dimension may at first seem odd, particularly given that the familiar definition from linear algebra (concerned with the number of vectors within a basis for a vector space cite:larsonElementaryLinearAlgebra1991) is strictly an integer value, but in the early \(20^{\mathrm{th}}\) century mathematicians recognized the shortcomings of this definition [[cite:mandelbrotFractalGeometryNature1982][Ch. 3]].

In this section we hope to convince the reader that there is grounds for
extending the definition of dimension and as a matter of fact many definitions
for non-integer dimensions of a shape have been proposed (see generally
[[cite:mandelbrotFractalGeometryNature1982][Ch. 39]] and
[[cite:gouyetPhysicsFractalStructures1996][\S 1.3]]) of these the Hausdorff Dimension (and corresponding Hausdorff Measure) is
considered to be the most important and mathematically robust
[[cite:falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b][p. 27]], while the /Box-Counting Dimension/ (introduced in \S [[#box-count-dim]])
has the most practical applications in science
[[cite:peitgenChaosFractalsNew2004][p. 192]].

The Hausdorff dimension is more like counting balls than boxes and is identical
to the Box-Counting Dimension in many cases, it's more general but harder to define
cite:sandersonFractalsAreTypically2017, An extension to the work of this report
would be to show the mathematical connections between the Hausdorff Dimension
and box counting dimension with respect to the fractals generated and measured.


*** Topological Equivalence                                                   :Ryan:

Topology is an area of mathematics concerned with ideas of continuity through the study of figures that are preserved under homeomorphic transformations cite:gilmoreTopologyChaosAlice2002 , where two figures are said to be homeomorphic if there is a continuous bijective mapping between the two shapes [[cite:peitgenChaosFractalsNew2004][p. 105]]
.
[fn:: For further reading on this topic see [[cite:peitgenChaosFractalsNew2004][p. 106]] ]

So for example deforming a cube into a sphere would be homeomorphic, but deforming a sphere into a torus would not, because the the surface of the shape would have to be compromised to achieve that.

Historically, as mentioned in \S [[#definition]], the concept of dimension was a difficult problem with a tenuous
definition.  Although an intuitive definition relates the dimension of a shape to
the number of perpendicular directions in which that shape spans, this definition is not
sufficient to be preserved under a homeomorphic transformation.

Consider the Koch curve, which could result from such a transformation applied
to a line, in this shape such as transformation is applied iteratively as shown in Figure [[koch-line]] (see also Figure [[koch-snowflake]] which
could result from a homeomorphic transofrmation applied to a regular 2D shape) and at each iteration (\(n\)) the perimeter is given by \(p_{n}= \left(\frac{4}{3}
\right)p_{n-1}\) and the number of edges by \(N_{n}\):



\begin{align}
N_{n} &= N_{n-1} \cdot 4 \\
&= 3 \cdot 4^{n}
\end{align}

If the length of any individual side was given by $l$ and scaled by some value $s$ then the length of each individual edge would be given by:

\begin{align}
l = \frac{s \cdot l_{0}}{3^{n}}
\end{align}

The total perimeter would be given by:

\begin{align}
p_{n} &= N_{n} \times l \\
&= 3\cdot 4^{n} \times \frac{s \cdot l_{o}}{3^{n}} \\
&= 3 \cdot s \cdot  l_{0} \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)^{n}\\
 \implies p_{n} \cdot s & \propto \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{n}\\
& \implies  n = \frac{\log\left( 4 \right)}{\log\left( 3 \right)} \approx 1.26 \label{eq:koch-dim}
\end{align}

This means that if the Koch line is scaled by any factor, the resulting
perimeter of the snowflake will not be directly proportional to the scaling
factor, as would be the case with a line, it will instead be proportional to
\(s^{1.26}\), this should hopefully motivate the need to more clearly define both the
concept of measure (in this case the perimeter [fn:: Grant Sanderson equates the
measure of a fractal as analogous to mass, which is a very helpful way
comparison cite:sandersonFractalsAreTypically2017]) and dimension. To clarify the Koch Line and  Koch snowflake, are both defined such that there are no edges, every point on the "curve" is the vertex of an equilateral triangle, this shape has no smooth edges, see [[cite:strogatzNonlinearDynamicsChaos2015][p. 414]] and [[cite:baderSpacefillingCurvesIntroduction2013][\S 5.4]] for further reading on the self similar dimension of the /Koch Snowflake/.

This approach of considering the scaling factor of a deterministic fractal is
known as the similarity dimension [[cite:strogatzNonlinearDynamicsChaos2015][p.
413]] and should be equal to the Hausdorff and box counting dimensions for most
fractals. For fractals that aren't so obviously self similar it won't be
feasible however [[cite:liIntegrationFuzzyLogic2006][p. 393]], for example with
the Julia Set [fn:: It is indeed shown to be
mostly constant at all scales in section \S [[#jl-set-dim]] ] or the outline of a coastline it is not immediately clear if the
the dimension would be constant at all scales

Let $F$ be some arbitrary subset of euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, [fn:: A subset of euclidean space could be interpreted as an uncountable set containing all points describing that region]

Let \(U\) be a subset of euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) such that the diameter is defined as the greatest distance between any of the points:

\[
\left\lvert U \right\rvert = \mathrm{sup}\left(\left\{ \left\lvert x- y \right\rvert \enspace : \enspace x,y \in U\right\}  \right)
\]

Consider a collection of these sets,

\[
G = \left\{U_i: i \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\right\}
\]

such that each element has a diameter less than \(\delta\).


The motivating idea is that if the elements of $G$ can be laid on-top of
$F$ then \(G\) is said to be a $\delta$ -cover of $F$, more rigorously, \(G\) is a \(\delta\)-cover of \(F\) if: [fn:: Falconer defines this as \(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}\) [[cite:falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b][\S 2.1]],
presumably treating any index value greater than the cardinality of the set as \(\emptyset\), this is particularly ambiguous and we have avoided it, an alternative way to present that might be \(\bigcup^{\#G}_{i=0}\) where \(\#G\) denotes the cardinality or \(G\) (or \(\infty\) if it is uncountable). The use of \(\#\square\) to denote cardinality was introduced by Knuth in /Concrete Mathematics/ cite:grahamConcreteMathematicsFoundation1994 and is convenient in that it avoids any ambiguity  with diameter (\(\left\lvert \square \right\rvert \)).]

\begin{align}
    F \subset \bigcup_{U\in B} \left( U \right) \quad :\quad 0 \leq \left\lvert U \right\rvert \leq \delta \label{eq:hausdorff-covering}
\end{align}



An example of this covering is provided in Figure [[hausdorff-covering]], in that example the figure on the right is covered by squares, which each could be an element of $\{U_{i}\}$, it is important to note, by this definition, that the shapes represented by \(U\) could be any arbitrary figure [[cite:falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b][\S 2.1]] the size of which may vary in size so long as the diameter is less than \(\delta\).


So for example:

- $F$ could be some arbitrary 2D shape, and $U_{i}$ could be
  a collection of identical squares, OR

- $F$ could be the outline of a coastline and $U_{i}$ could be a set of circles, OR

- $F$ could be the surface of a sheet and $U_{i}$ could be a set of spherical balls as shown in Figure [[fig:ball-covering]]

  + Some authors suggest that the Hausdorff Measure is concerned primarily with round covering objects (see e.g. cite:sandersonFractalsAreTypically2017), this is well illustrated by Figure [[fig:ball-covering]], however in truth it is merely more convenient to use round shapes for most fractals.

  + The use of balls is a simpler but equivalent approach to the theory [[cite:falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b][\textsection 2.4 ]] because any set of diameter $r$ can be enclosed in a ball of radius $\frac{r}{2}$ [[cite:edgarMeasureTopologyFractal2008][p. 166]]

- $F$ could be a more abstracted figure like Figures [[hausdorff-covering]] or [[abstract-shape]]  and $\{U_{i}\}$ a collection of various different lines, shapes or 3d objects.

The Hausdorff measure is concerned with only the diameter of each element of $\{U_{i}\}$ and considers \(\sum_{U \in G} \left[\left\lvert U\right\rvert^{s}\right]\) where each element \(U\in G\) is arranged so as to minimize the value of the summation [[cite:falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b][p. 27]]
, the \(\delta\)-Hausdorff is hence defined, for various dimensions \(s\):

\begin{align}
\mathcal{H}^s_{\delta}\left( F \right)= \inf \left\{ \sum_{U\in G}   \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \enspace : \enspace  \left\{U_i\right\} \text{ is a } \delta \text{-cover of } F \right\}, \quad \delta, s > 0 \label{eq:delta-measure}
\end{align}

The value of \(s\) can be different regardless of the dimension of \(F\), for example if \(F\) was an arbitrary 2D shape the value of \(\mathcal{H}_{\delta}^{2}\left(F\right)\)
is equivalent to considering the number of shapes \(U\in G\) (e.g. boxes, discs etc.), of
diameter $\leq \delta$ that will cover over a shape as shown in Figure
[[hausdorff-covering]], the delta Hausdorff measure
$\mathcal{H}^{2}_{\delta} \left(F\right)$ will be the area of the boxes when
arranged in such a way that minimizes the area.

As $\delta$ is made arbitrarily small $\mathcal{H}_{\delta}^{s}$ will approach some limit, in the case of Figures [[hausdorff-covering]]  and [[abstract-shape]] the value of $\mathcal{H}^{2}_{\delta}$ will approach the area of the shape as $\delta \rightarrow 0$ and so the $s^{th}$ dimensional Hausdorff measure is given by:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{H}^{s} = \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\left( \mathcal{H}^{s}_{\delta} \right) \label{eq:limit-haus}
\end{align}

This is defined for all subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) for example the value of  $\mathcal{H}^{2}$ corresponding to Figure [[abstract-shape]] will be limit that boxes would approach when covering that area, which would be the area of the shape ($4\times 1^2 + 4\times \pi\times \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2}\times 1 \times \sin{\frac{\pi}{3}}$).

**** Lower Dimension Hausdorff Measurements
***** Examples
Consider again the example of a 2D shape, the value of $\mathcal{H}^{1}$ would still be defined by eqref:eq:delta-measure, but unlike $\mathcal{H}^{2}$ in \S [[#hausdorff-measure]] the value of $\left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^1$ would be considered as opposed to $\left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^2$ (i.e. the diameter as opposed to the diameter squared).

As $\delta$ is made arbitrarily small the boxes [fn:: Even though \(U\) may contain a variety of shapes, eqref:eq:delta-measure is concerned only with the power of there diameter, so in this sense the limit is concerned only with boxes corresponding to the diameter of the elements of \(U\)] that cover the shape are made also to be arbitrarily small. Although the area of the boxes must clearly be bounded by the shape of $F$, if one imagines an infinite number of infinitely dense lines packing into a 2D shape with an infinite density it can be seen that the total length of those lines will be infinite and so the limit in eqref:eq:limit-haus will increase without bound.

To build on that same analogy, another way to imagine this is to pack a 2D shape with straight lines, the total length of all lines will approach the same value as the length of the lines of the squares as they are packed infinitely densely. Because lines cannot fill a 2D shape, as the density of the lines increases, the overall length will increase without bound.

This is consistent with fractals as well, consider the Koch snowflake introduced in section [[#topological-equivalence]] and shown in Figure [[koch-line]], the dimension of this shape, as shown in \S [[#topological-equivalence]] is greater than 1, and the number of lines necessary to describe that shape is also infinite because every point of the "curve" is a point of an equilateral triangle.

***** TODO Formally
If the dimension of $F$ is less than $s$, the Hausdorff Measure will be given by:

\begin{align}
\mathrm{dim}\left(  F \right ) < s \implies \mathcal{H}^{s} \left( F \right)  = \infty
\end{align}

**** Higher Dimension Hausdorff Dimension


For small values of $s$ (i.e. less than the dimension of  $F$), the value of $\mathcal{H}^s$  will be $\infty$.

Consider some value $s$ such that the Hausdorff measure is not infinite, i.e. values of $s$:

\[
\mathcal{H}^s = L \in \mathbb{R}
\]

Consider a dimensional value $t$ that is larger than  $s$ and observe that:

\begin{align*}
0<s<t  \implies   \sum_{i}  \left[ \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^t \right] &= \sum_{i}\left[ \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^{t- s} \cdot  \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \right] \\
&\leq \sum_{i} \left[ \delta^{t - s} \cdot \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s  \right]    \\
&= \delta^{t- s}\sum_{i}   \left[ \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \right] 									   \\
\end{align*}

Now if $\lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\left[ \sum_{i}   \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \right]$ is defined as a non-infinite value:

\begin{align}
    \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0} \left( \sum_{i}   \left[ \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^t \right]  \right) & \leq \lim_{\delta}\left( \delta^{t- s} \sum_{i}   \left[ \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \right]  \right) \\
&\leq \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\left( \delta^{t - s} \right) \cdot  \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\left( \sum_{i} \left[ \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \right]    \right) \\
&\leq 0
\end{align}

and so we have the following relationship:

\begin{align}
    \mathcal{H}^{s} \left(F\right) \in \mathbb{R}^{+}  \implies  \mathcal{H}^t\left( F \right)= 0 \quad \forall t > s \label{eq:hdfzero}
\end{align}

Hence the value of the s-dimensional /Hausdorff Measure/, $s$ is only a finite, non-zero value, when $s = \mathrm{dim}_{H}\left( F \right)$.

While the Hausdorff dimension is the first formal definition to measure
the roughness of a fractal, there are several other definitions of dimension
that have stemmed from this. Namely, the box-counting dimension. The box
counting method is widely used as it is relatively easy to calculate [[cite:falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b][p. 41]]
and in many cases is equal to the /Hausdorff Dimension/  [[cite:markpollicottFractalsDimensionTheory2005][p. 11]] (see generally cite:ListFractalsHausdorff2020).
The box-counting dimension is defined as the following from
cite:falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003:

Let $F$ be any non-empty bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $N_\delta(F)$ be the smallest
number of sets of diameter at most $\delta$ which can cover $F$. The /lower/ and /upper/
box-counting dimensions of $F$ respectively are defined as

\begin{equation*}
    \underline{\text{dim}}_BF = \underline{\lim}_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\ln N_\delta(F)}{-\ln \delta}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\overline{\text{dim}}_BF = \overline{\lim}_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\ln N_\delta(F)}{-\ln \delta}
\end{equation*}

When the /lower/ and /upper/ box-counting dimensions of $F$ are equal, then

\begin{equation*}
\text{dim}_BF = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\ln N_\delta(F)}{-\ln \delta}
\end{equation*}

For example, suppose we had a square with side length 1 and we use smaller squares of side
length $\frac{1}{\delta}$ to cover the larger square. This would mean that one side of the
large square would need $\delta$ $\frac{1}{\delta}$ small squares, and so to cover
the entire square, one would need $n^2$ small squares, i.e. $N_{\frac{1}{n}}(F) = n^2$. Now,
substituting these values into the box-counting definition, we get:

\begin{align*}
\text{dim}_BF &= \lim_{\frac{1}{\delta} \to 0} \frac{\ln(\delta^2)}{-\ln(\frac{1}{\delta})}\\
&= \lim_{\frac{1}{\delta} \to 0} \frac{\ln(\delta^2)}{\ln(\delta)}\\
&= \lim_{\frac{1}{\delta} \to 0} 2\frac{\ln(\delta)}{\ln(\delta)}\\
&= 2
\end{align*}

Which is expected, because we know that a square is a 2-Dimensional shape. We
can apply this same concept to fractals. Consider another example, the Koch
Curve, a self similar fractal which we can calculate its dimension and provide a
measure of roughness of the curve. If we take a close look at the curve progression
in Figure [[koch-line]], the pattern begins with one line segment and the middle third
of the line is replaced with two sides of an equilateral triangle with side length
$\frac{1}{3}$. After this first iteration, the line segment now becomes four line
segments. Thus, if we use a square of length $\frac{1}{3^{\delta}}$ to cover the $\delta^{th}$
iteration of the curve, there will be $4^{\delta}$ line segments covered.

Let $F$ be the Koch Curve.
\begin{align*}
\text{dim}_BF &= \lim_{\frac{1}{3^{\delta}} \to 0} \frac{\ln(4^{\delta})}{-\ln(\frac{1}{3^{\delta}})}\\
&= \lim_{\frac{1}{3^{\delta}} \to 0} \frac{\ln(4^{\delta})}{\ln(3^{\delta})}\\
&= \lim_{\frac{1}{3^{\delta}} \to 0} \frac{\ln(4)}{\ln(3)}\\
&= \frac{\ln(4)}{\ln(3)}
\end{align*}

The Vicsek Fractal [[cite:vicsekFractalGrowthPhenomena1992][p. 12]] involves a pattern of iterating boxes, to implement this consider the process[fn:: This was actually a fractal I came up with myself only to later find that somebody already had the same idea!]:



\begin{align}
\mathbf{B} \leftarrow
   \begin{bmatrix}
       \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{B} \\
       \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{Z} \\
       \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{B} \\
   \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:visek-iter}
\end{align}

where:

- \(\mathbf{B}= \left[ 1 \right]\)
- \(\mathbf{Z}= \left[ 0 \right]  \)

#+CAPTION: Vicsek fractal [[cite:vicsekFractalGrowthPhenomena1992][p. 12]] (also known as the /Anti-Cross-Stitch/ cite:janwassenaarCantorDust2005) produced by listing [[vicsek-matrix-gen]], at each iterative step the fractal itself is "copied" to the four corners of itself producing this complex shape.
[[file:media/Vicsek-Fractal.png]]

If this is repeated many times a matrix of values will be created, such a matrix
can be interpreted as a greyscale image and plotted as a heat-map to show the
fractal (shown in Figure [[vicsek-fratal-julia]]).


The iterative process shown in eqref:eq:visek-iter is represented as a recursive function at line 5 of listing [[vicsek-matrix-gen]] and visualized at line 22. To measure the the dimension of this fractal a the sum of the matrix is taken to be the measure of the fractal, two fractals are generated and the change in size relative to the scale is compared and the log taken to return the value of the dimension:

\[
\mathcal{D} = \frac{s}{m_{2}/m_{1}}
\]

The recursive function begins with a 3x3 matrix, where the four corner squares
and middle square are set to 1 and the rest are set to 0, a new matrix is built
by joining together the past matrix following the rule described in eqref:eq:visek-iter.
The function repeats until it reaches some arbitrary set width.





At each step of the process, the number of elements of this fractal increases by
a ratio of 5 while the height increases only by a factor of 3, hence the self
similarity dimension is given by:


\begin{align}
5 &= 3^{\mathcal{D}} \nonumber \\
\implies \mathcal{D} &= \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 3} \label{eq:vic-dim-val}
\end{align}





By modifying listing [[vicsek-matrix-gen]] alternative fractals can get also be generated like /Cantor's Dust/ and /Sierpinski's Carpet/ shown in Figures [[fig:cantor-dust]] and [[fig:sierpinski-carpet]].

Upon review this is actually a variant on the /Cantor Dust/ which should
actually be represented by a \(3 \times 3\) matrix:

\begin{align}
 \mathbf{B} \leftarrow
 \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{B} \\
    \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{Z} \\
    \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{B} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}


and hence has the same dimension as the /Vicsek Fractal/ as opposed to a
dimension of 1.

**** Sierpinski's Triangle
Not all fractal patterns can be produced by using recursive functions involving matrices, one such function is /Sierpinski's Triangle/.
***** Chaos Game
The chaos game is a technique that can generate fractals, one of the advantages of this approach is that it can provide an estimate of the theoretical measure of a fractal without needing to iterate a function many times. The technique involves marking 3 points of an equilateral triangle and marking an arbitrary point, select one of these 3 points randomly with a uniform probability and create a new point halfway between the previous point and this point, repeat this process for as many points of detail are desired for the image.

This can be visualized by mapping the co-ordinates of an equilateral triangle to a Cartesian plane:

- \(A\)  \(\left(0, 0\right)\)
- \(B\)  \(\left(0, 1\right)\)
- \(C\)  \(\left(0.5, \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right)\)

The mean value of the \(x\), \(y\) values for these co-ordinates is equal to the
halfway point and using this the chaos game can be implemented as a program and
visualized by plotting each point on a scatter plot. This is implemented in
/*R*/ in listing [[l-sier-tri]] and the output is shown in Figure [[fig:s-tri]].

To measure the fractal dimension of this could be done by mapping the Cartesian
plane back to a matrix and taking the same approach as previous fractals
presented, this however was not implemented, due to time constraints, the
dimension was however measured using the method discussed at \S [[#pas-tri]].

The even and odd values in /Pascal's Triangle/ demonstrate the same pattern as
the /Sierpinski Triangle/ this is discussed in greater detail in \S
[[#pascal-sierpinski]], implementing this to produce the sierpinski triangle is very
simple, it is however significantly more resource intensive, even in /Julia/
than using the chaos game and the the measured dimension converges to the self
similar dimension very slowly.

The fractal produced is composed of right angle triangles, as opposed to equilateral triangles but interestingly the measured dimension is still the same as an equilateral /Sierpinski's Triangle/, it does however converge to this value slowly.

Some Fractals cannot be well explained by using matrices or the chaos game, Turtle graphics are a programmatic way to draw a pen across a screen, these are implemented in /Julia/ using the /Luxor/ package cite:JuliaGraphicsLuxorJl2020.



We were unfortunately unable to implement a strategy to measure the dimension
of such fractals, one such approach that looked promising but did not return
consistent results was to export the generated image to a PNG and then import
that file as a matrix using the /Python Pillow Library/ cite:PillowPillowPIL or
the /Julia Images/ library cite:JuliaImagesImagesJl2020, when this was
unsuccessful we also experimented with /ImageMagick/ cite:llcImageMagick,
/AstroPy/ cite:Astropy and /JuliaAstro/ cite:JuliaAstroJuliaAstro.
Unfortunately the values returned by this approach were inconsistent and
further investigation into this method is required.

*** Pascals Triangle and Sierpinski's Triangle                                :James:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pascal-sierpinski
:END:
**** Motivation
Over many centuries, mathematicians have been able to produce a range of patterns from Pascal's triangle. One of which is relevant to the emergence of Sierpinski's triangle. To construct Pascal's triangle it begins with a 1 in the $0^{th}$ (top) row, then each row underneath is made up of the sum of the numbers directly above it, see Figure [[fig:pascal-triangle]]. Alternatively, the $n^{th}$ row and $k^{th}$ column can be written in combinatorics form, $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$.

#+att_latex: :width 0.38\textwidth :float wrap
[[file:media/tikz/pascals-triangle.png]]

**** The connection
As mentioned before there is one pattern that produces the Sierpinski triangle, namely highlighting all odd numbers in Pascal's triangle. This is equivalent to considering all the numbers in the triangle modulo 2, shown in Figure [[fig:pascal-sierpinski-tri]].

#+attr_html: :width 300px

#+NAME: fig:row-column-pascal
#+CAPTION: The black squares represent one example of a position on Pascal's triangle that are equivalent modulo 2
[[file:media/tikz/row-column-pascal.png]]

In Figure [[fig:pascal-sierpinski-tri]], we can observe that all the highlighted odd numbers begin to form the Sierpinski triangle. Note that this is not the complete Sierpinski's triangle, that would require an infinite number of iterations. Now, we also notice that there are three identical Sierpinski triangles within the larger triangle, each containing the same value modulo 2, at each corresponding row and column.

To prove this, we need to split the triangle into two parts, $P_{n}$ denoting the first $2^{n}$ rows, i.e. the top "Sierpinski triangle" in Figure [[fig:pascal-sierpinski-tri]] and $P_{n+1}$ representing the entire triangle. We must show that any chosen square in $P_{n}$ is equal to the corresponding row and column in the lower two triangles of $P_{n+1}$, shown in Figure [[fig:row-column-pascal]]. This requires an identity that allows us to work with combinations in modulo 2, namely Lucas' Theorem.

**** The connection
Let $n,k \ge 0$ and for some prime $p$, we get:
\begin{equation}
\binom{n}{k} = \prod_{i=0}^{m} \binom{n_i}{k_i} \quad (\text{mod}~p)
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{align*}
n &= n_{m}p^{m}+n_{m-1}p^{m-1}+\cdots + n_{1}p+n_{0},\\
k &= k_{m}p^{m}+k_{m-1}p^{m-1}+\cdots + k_{1}p+k_{0}\\
\end{align*}
are the expansions in radix $p$ [fn:: Radix refers to a numerical system which uses some number of digits. Since we are working in modulo 2 for Pascal's triangle, we are only concerned with the numbers $0$ or $1$, i.e. a radix 2 or a binary numeric system.]. This uses the convention that $\binom{n}{k} = 0$ if $k < n$

Take some arbitrary row $r$ and column $c$ in the triangle $P_{n}$. If we add $2^{n}$ rows to $r$, we will reach the equivalent row and column in the lower left triangle of $P_{n+1}$, since there are $2^{n}$ rows in $P_{n}$. In the same way, if we add $2^{n}$ columns to $c$ we reach the equivalent row and column in the lower right triangle of $P_{n+1}$, leaving us with:

\begin{align*}
\text{Top Triangle:} \quad &\binom{r}{c}  \\
\text{Bottom-left Triangle:}\quad &\binom{r + 2^n}{c}  \\
\text{Bottom-right Triangle :}\quad &\binom{r + 2^n}{c + 2^n} \label{eq:bottom-right}
\end{align*}

Using Lucas' theorem, we can prove that the above statements are equivalent.

We can rewrite $r$ and $c$ in base 2 notation as follows:
\begin{align*}
r=r_{i}2^{i}+r_{i-1}2^{i-1}+\cdots + r_{1}2+r_{0}= \left[r_{i}r_{i-1}\cdots r_{1}r_{0}\right]_2\\
c=c_{i}2^{i}+c_{i-1}2^{i-1}+\cdots +c_{1}2+c_{0}=\left[c_{i}c_{i-1}\cdots c_{1}c_{0}\right]_2\\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\binom{2^n + r}{c} &\equiv \binom{1r_{i-1}r_{i-2} \cdots r_{0}}{0c_{i-1}c_{i-2} \cdots c_{0}} \quad &(\text{mod} 2)\\
&\equiv \binom{1}{0}\binom{r_{i-1}}{c_{i-1}}\binom{r_{i-2}}{c_{i-2}} \cdots \binom{r_0}{c_0} \quad &(\text{mod} 2)\\
&\equiv\binom{r_{i-1}}{c_{i-1}}\binom{r_{i-2}}{c_{i-2}} \cdots \binom{r_0}{c_0} \quad &(\text{mod} 2)\\
&\equiv \binom{r}{c} \quad &(\text{mod} 2)
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\binom{2^n + r}{2^n + c} &\equiv \binom{1r_{i-1}r_{i-2} \cdots r_{0}}{1c_{i-1}c_{i-2} \cdots c_{0}} \quad &(\text{mod} 2)\\
&\equiv \binom{1}{1}\binom{r_{i-1}}{c_{i-1}}\binom{r_{i-2}}{c_{i-2}} \cdots \binom{r_0}{c_0} \quad &(\text{mod} 2)\\
&\equiv \binom{r_{i-1}}{c_{i-1}}\binom{r_{i-2}}{c_{i-2}} \cdots \binom{r_0}{c_0} \quad &(\text{mod} 2)\\
&\equiv \binom{r}{c} \quad &(\text{mod} 2)
\end{align*}

Thus, $\binom{r}{c} = \binom{2^n + r}{c} = \binom{2^n + r}{2^n + c} \quad (\text{mod} 2)$, which concludes the proof

discussed in \S [[#definition]], are a common example but are not unique in this
regard, many natural phenomena such as the distribution of galaxies, shape of
clouds, outline of mountains and the the path of Brownian motion have a fractal structure
 [[cite:gouyetPhysicsFractalStructures1996][Ch. 2]] that does not exhibit
obvious self-similarity.

In order to measure the dimension of such fractals the log transformed measure
and scale can be compared on a scatter plot in order to confirm that the
relationship is linear, if the relationship is linear the dimension is constant
and equal to the slope of the line, (see e.g. [[cite:vicsekFractalGrowthPhenomena1992][\S 4.2]],
cite:sandersonFractalsAreTypically2017 and cite:mandelbrotHowLongCoast1967).

This approach is implemented to measure the dimension of the /Julia Set/ in \S [[#dim-julia]].

In order to better understand the ways in which complex fractal patterns can
emerge from simple processes, a simple process that
leads to the emergence of such a pattern has been constructed, this is not a pattern that we have been able to find discussed in the literature but it does show simple connection between simple processes, patterns and the emergence of values such as golden ratio and the Fibonacci Sequence.

** Constructing a Simple Process
Consider a fractal that begins simply with a square
@@latex: \begin{tikzpicture}\node at (3,0) [fill=red, rectangle,draw] (00) {};\end{tikzpicture} @@,
imagine that this square is replicated, rotated and appended
#+LATEX: \begin{tikzpicture} \node[] (orig) at (0,0) {}; \node at (orig) [fill=red, rectangle,draw] {}; \node[xshift=1.72ex] at (orig) [fill=red, rectangle,draw] (01) {};\end{tikzpicture}
, then that shape, again is replicated rotated and appended
#+LATEX: \begin{tikzpicture} \node[] (orig) at (0,0) {}; \node at (orig) [fill=red, rectangle,draw] {}; \node[xshift=1.72ex] at (orig) [fill=red, rectangle,draw] (01) {}; \node[xshift=3.44ex] at (orig) [fill=red, rectangle,draw] (01) {}; \node[xshift=3.44ex, yshift=-1.72ex] at (orig) [fill=red, rectangle,draw] (01) {}; \end{tikzpicture}
,this    process is illustrated in Figure [[My-Frac-progression-ink]], and if perpetuated a pattern emerges, as shown in Figure [[My-Frac-GR-plot]], this fractal can be generated by joining two matrices together in a manner that is consistent with the pattern described, this is shown in listing [[gen-frac-code]].

[[file:../Problems/fractal-dimensions/My-Fib-Fractal-Diagram.svg]]

** The Fibonacci Numbers

The fractal demonstrates a pattern that follows an angle that is caused by the
join of the replicated and rotated unit [fn:sh], the shape of these joins is a
rectangle that follows the Fibonacci numbers due to the additive nature of the
process, this is illustrated in Figure [[My-Frac-ink-blue]], in \S
[[fib-golden-ratio-proof]] it is shown that \(\lim
\left(\frac{F_{n}}{F_{n-1}}\right) = \varphi\), this means that the edges of the
fractal are proportional to one another as shown in listing [[My-Frac-ink-fade]] and
so the angle can be given by the following relationship:

\begin{align}
    \theta &= \tan^{- 1} \left(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{F_{n- 2}}{F_{n}}                 \right)        \right) \\
            &= \tan^{- 1} \left(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{F_{n- 2}}{F_{n- 1}+  F_{n- 2}}   \right)        \right) \\
            &= \tan^{- 1} \left(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{F_{n}}{F_{n+ 1}+  F_{n}}         \right)         \right)
	    \intertext{Because \(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left( \frac{F_n}{F_{n- 1}} \right) = \varphi \approx 1.618 \)  we can substite the values:} \notag\\
	    &= \tan^{-1} \left( \varphi\left( \varphi + 1  \right) \right) \\
	    &= \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\psi}{\varphi +  1}\right) \\
	    &\approx 0.231^{\mathrm{c}}
\end{align}


this is illustrated in Figures [[My-Frac-ink-blue]] and [[My-Frac-ink-fade]]. This angle can be contrasted to the golden angle visualized in Figure [[My-Frac-gold-angle]] and although different it interesting to note that \(  2 \pi\left( \frac{\psi}{\varphi+1}\right) \equiv 2 \pi \psi \equiv 0 \pmod \psi \)
.

** The Dimension of the Fractal
Each time this fractal is iterated the measure (i.e. the number of boxes) is doubled, but the scale of the fractal is increased by a ratio of the width and height, because the boxes add up this ratio will be a ratio of Fibonacci numbers which is shown to be equal to the golden ratio \(\phi\) in \S [[#fib-golden-ratio-proof]], hence the dimension of this fractal is given by:

\begin{align}
\log_{\varphi}\left(2\right) &= \frac{\log (2)}{\log (\varphi)} \\
&\approx 1.44042
\end{align}

This value is consistent with measurements performed using /Julia/ in listing [[my-frac-measure-dim]].

* The Fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio
:PROPERTIES:

** The Golden Ratio                                                            :Ryan:
The /Fibonacci Sequence/ and /Golden Ratio/ occur in many patterns observed
in natural phenomena (see
cite:shellyallenFibonacciNature,benedettapalazzoNumbersNatureFibonacci2016,MinarovaNikoletta2014TFSN,NatureGoldenRatio2018,robertlambHowAreFibonacci2008,ronknottFibonacciNumbersGolden2016),
an example of such an occurrence is discussed in section [[#sunflower-example]] and
a simple process demonstrating the emergence of the Fibonacci Numbers
is discussed in \S [[#my-fractal]].

The Golden Ratio is a value \(\varphi\) that satisfies the following property:

\begin{align}
    \frac{a}{b} &=  \frac{a+  b}{a}= \varphi \nonumber \\
    \varphi &= 1+ \frac{1}{\varphi} \nonumber \\
    \implies  \varphi^2 &= \varphi +  1 \label{eq:phi-sim-to-fib-rec} \\
    \implies  \varphi &= \frac{1+ \sqrt{5} }{2} \label{eq:phi-value}
\end{align}

An interesting property of the golden ratio is that successive ratios of the
Fibonacci numbers converge to the golden ratio.

Consider the series:

$$\begin{aligned}
G_n &= \frac{F_{n} }{F_{n - 1} } \\
\end{aligned}$$

Such that \(F_{n}\) is the \(n^{\mathrm{th}}\) Fibonacci Number:

$$\begin{aligned}
F_n = F_{n- 1} +  F_{n- 2} ; \quad F_1 = F_2 = 1
\end{aligned}$$

** Golden Ratio In terms of the Fibonacci Sequence                             :James:
The Series \(G\) is alternating convergent series, to show that consider the two sub-sequences formed by taking the odd and even ratios, these are both bounded monotone sequences.
*** Prove that the Sequence is Bounded
Since we are trying to show that the ratio of Fibonacci numbers converges by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we will let $G_n$ be as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    G_n = \bigg\{ \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} \bigg\}_{n=1}^\infty, \quad F_1=F_2=1
\end{equation*}
To show $G_n$ is bounded we must consider the following sub sequences,

i) $\{G_{2n}\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is bounded below and decreasing
i) $\{G_{2n-1}\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is bounded above and increasing


Proving part 1:\\

To show $\{G_{2n}\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is decreasing we will show $G_{2n} - G_{2(n+1)} > 0$ through the process of induction.

Proof: \\
For least element $n = 1$:\\
\begin{align*}
    G_2 - G_4 &= \frac{F_3}{F_2} - \frac{F_5}{F_4}\\
    &= \frac{2}{1} - \frac{5}{3}\\
    &> 0
\end{align*}
Now assume true for all $n$:\\
\begin{equation*}
    G_{2n} - G_{2(n+1)} > 0 \implies \frac{G_{2n}}{G_{2(n+1)}} > 1
\end{equation*}
Prove true for $n+1$:
\begin{align*}
    G_{2(n+1)} - G_{2(n+2)} &= G_{2n + 2} - G_{2n+4)}\\
    &= \frac{F_{2n+3}}{F_{2n+2}} - \frac{F_{2n+5}}{F_{2n+4}}\\
    &= \frac{F_{2n+3}F_{2n+4} - F_{2n+5}F_{2n+2}}{F_{2n+2}F_{2n+4}}\\
    &= \frac{F_{2n+3}(F_{2n+3}+F_{2n+2}) - F_{2n+2}(F_{2n+4}+F_{2n+3})}{F_{2n+2}F_{2n+4}}\\
    &= \frac{(F_{2n+3})^2 - F_{2n+2}F_{2n+4}}{F_{2n+2}F_{2n+4}}\\
    &= \frac{(F_{2n+3})^2}{F_{2n+2}F_{2n+4}} - 1\\
    &= \frac{F_{2n+3}}{F_{2n+2}} \cdot \frac{F_{2n+3}}{F_{2n+4}} -1\\
    &= \frac{G_{2n+2}}{G_{2n+3}} - 1\\
\end{align*}
Since $\frac{G_{2n}}{G_{2(n+1)}} > 1$ for all $n$ by assumption, then $\frac{G_{2n+2}}{G_{2n+3}} > 1$  follows, hence
\begin{align*}
    G_{2(n+1)} - G_{2(n+2)} &= \frac{G_{2n+2}}{G_{2n+3}} - 1\\
    &> 1 -1\\
    &> 0
\end{align*}
Therefore by mathematical induction, $G_{2n}$ is monotic decreasing.\\
Now, for $\{G_{2n}\}_{n=1}^\infty$ to be bounded below we will consider the entire set $G_n$, hence:
\begin{equation*}
    G_n = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} =  \frac{F_n + F_{n-1}}{F_n} = 1 + \frac{F_{n-1}}{F_n}
\end{equation*}
Since all Fibonacci numbers are positive, $\frac{F_{n-1}}{F_n} > 0$, so
\begin{equation*}
    G_n = 1 + \frac{F_{n-1}}{F_n} > 1
\end{equation*}
Thus $G_n$ being bounded below implies $G_{2n}$ is also bounded below.

Proving part 2:\\
To show $\{G_{2n-1}\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is increasing we will show $G_{2n-1} - G_{2(n+1)-1} < 0$ through the process of induction.

Proof: \\
For least element $n = 1$:\\
\begin{align*}
    G_1 - G_3 &= \frac{F_2}{F_1} - \frac{F_4}{F_3}\\
    &= \frac{1}{1} - \frac{3}{2}\\
    &< 0
\end{align*}
Now assume true for all $n$:\\
\begin{equation*}
    G_{2n-1} - G_{2n+1} < 0 \implies \frac{G_{2n-1}}{G_{2n+1}} < 1
\end{equation*}
Prove true for $n+1$:
\begin{align*}
    G_{2(n+1) -1} - G_{2(n+1) + 1} &= G_{2n+1} - G_{2n+3}\\
    &= \frac{F_{2n+2}}{F_{2n+1}} - \frac{F_{2n+4}}{F_{2n+3}}\\
    &= \frac{F_{2n+2}F_{2n+3} - F_{2n+4}F_{2n+1}}{F_{2n+1}F_{2n+3}}\\
    &= \frac{F_{2n+2}(F_{2n+2}+F_{2n+1}) - F_{2n+1}(F_{2n+3}+F_{2n+2})}{F_{2n+1}F_{2n+3}}\\
    &= \frac{(F_{2n+2})^2 - F_{2n+1}F_{2n+3}}{F_{2n+1}F_{2n+3}}\\
    &= \frac{(F_{2n+2})^2}{F_{2n+1}F_{2n+3}} - 1\\
    &= \frac{F_{2n+2}}{F_{2n+1}} \cdot \frac{F_{2n+2}}{F_{2n+3}} -1\\
    &= \frac{G_{2n+1}}{G_{2n+2}} - 1\\
\end{align*}
Since $\frac{G_{2n-1}}{G_{2n+1}} < 1$ for all $n$ by assumption, then $\frac{G_{2n+1}}{G_{2n+2}} < 1$  follows, hence
\begin{align*}
    G_{2(n+1)-1} - G_{2(n+1)+1} &= \frac{G_{2n+1}}{G_{2n+2}} - 1\\
    &< 1 -1\\
    &< 0
\end{align*}
Therefore by mathematical induction, $G_{2n-1}$ is increasing.\\
Now, for $\{G_{2n-1}\}_{n=1}^\infty$ to be bounded above we will again consider the entire set $G_n$, hence:
\begin{equation*}
    G_n = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} =  \frac{F_n + F_{n-1}}{F_n} = 1 + \frac{F_{n-1}}{F_n}
\end{equation*}
Since $\frac{F_{n-1}}{F_n} \le 1$ we can deduce that
\begin{equation*}
    G_n = 1 + \frac{F_{n-1}}{F_n} \le 2
\end{equation*}
Thus $G_n$ being bounded above by 2 implies $G_{2n-1}$ is also bounded above by 2.
*** Find the Limit                                                           
By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, $\lim_{n \to \infty} G_n$ exists.
We will assume that $G_{2n}$ and $G_{2n-1}$ approach the same limit $L~~\forall n \ge 1$
Meaning, we will also take:

\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{n\to \infty}G_n = \lim_{n\to \infty}G_{n-1} = L
\end{equation*}

\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to \infty}G_n &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{F_{n} +  F_{n+  1} }{F_{n+  1} } \\
&= 1 +  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{F_{n- 1} }{F_n} \\
&=  1 +  \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{G_{n-1}} \\
 \implies L &= 1 + \frac{1}{L}\\
 L^2 &= L + 1\\
 0 &= L^2 - L - 1\\
  \implies  L &= \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1  }{2} = \varphi
\end{align*}

In the 13\textsuperscript{th} century [fn:fib] Fibonacci developed [fn:dev]  his namesake sequence when working on a problem concerning the growth rate
of a rabbit population cite:ronknottFibonacciNumbersGolden2016.
Continuous population growth is typically modeled with calculus by the equation \(\frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} t}\left( p \right)
\propto p\) [[cite:giordanoFirstCourseMathematical2014][\S 11.1]], what's interesting is that this population model itself
generates a fractal when the number of stationary points is plotted against the
growth rate [[cite:briggsTurbulentMirrorIllustrated1989][Ch. 3]]
and this fractal is equivalent to a plot of the Mandelbrot Set (discussed in \S [[#mandlebrot-set]]) where the \(x\)-axis represents the real component of a value and the \(y\)-axis the number of iterations before a value exceeds a modulus of 2 (see generally cite:mullerThisEquationWill2020). This is not
something we had time to investigate unfortunately but it does demonstrate the deep connection between natural phenomena such as population growth, the Fibonacci Sequence and complex fractals such as the Mandelbrot set.
*** Equivalent forms of the Golden Ratio
The golden ratio is sometimes expressed in odd forms in the literature:


$$\begin{aligned}
\lim_{n     \rightarrow \infty }\left[ \frac{F_n}{F_{n- 1} }  \right] &= \varphi \\
\lim_{n     \rightarrow \infty }\left[ \frac{F_n}{F_{n- 1} }  \right] &= \psi \\
\varphi - \psi &=  1 \\
\varphi \times  \psi  &= 1 \\
\frac{\psi}{\varphi}  = \frac{1}{\varphi^2} = \frac{1}{1-\varphi} &= \frac{1}{2-\varphi} = \frac{2}{3 - \sqrt{5}  }
\end{aligned}$$
** A closed Solution for the Fibonacci Numbers                                 :Ryan:

    :CUSTOM_ID: solving-the-sequence
    :END:
The Fibonacci numbers can be solved  using Calculus and this closed solution can be used to show that the ratio of Fibonacci numbers converges to the golden ratio. [fn:gen]

Consider the /Fibonacci Sequence/:


\begin{align}
    a_{n}&= a_{n - 1} + a_{n - 2} \nonumber \\
\iff a_{n+  2} &= a_{n+  1} +  a_n \label{eq:fib-def-shift}
\end{align}

From observation, this appears similar in structure to the following /ordinary
differential equation/, which would be fairly easy to deal with:


\begin{align*}
f''\left( x \right)- f'\left( x \right)- f\left( x \right)=  0
\end{align*}

By ODE Theory we have $y \propto e^{m_{i}x}, \enspace i = 1, 2$ [[cite:zillDifferentialEquationsBoundaryvalue2009][\S 4.1.2]]
and the following power series [[cite:churchillComplexVariablesApplications2014][\S 64]]:

\begin{align*}
f\left( x \right)= e^{mx} = \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ r^{m} \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]
\end{align*}

So using some sort of a transformation involving a power series may help to
relate the discrete problem back to a continuous one.

Consider using the following generating function, (proof of the
generating function derivative as in eqref:eq:exp-gen-def-2 and eqref:eq:exp-gen-def-3 is
provided in section [[#Derivative-exp-gen-function]])




\begin{align}
    f\left( x \right) &=  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ a_{n} \cdot  \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]   \label{eq:exp-gen-def-1} \\
 \implies   f'\left( x \right) &=  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ a_{n+1} \cdot  \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]   \label{eq:exp-gen-def-2} \\
\implies    f''\left( x \right) &=  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ a_{n+2} \cdot  \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]   \label{eq:exp-gen-def-3}
\end{align}


So the Fibonacci recursive relation from eqref:eq:fib-def-shift  could be expressed :


\begin{align*}
a_{n+  2}    &= a_{n+  1} +  a_{n}\\
\frac{x^n}{n!}   a_{n+  2}    &= \frac{x^n}{n!}\left( a_{n+  1} +  a_{n}  \right)\\
\sum^{\infty}_{n= 0} \left[ \frac{x^n}{n!}   a_{n+  2} \right]        &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ \frac{x^n}{n!} a_{n+  1} \right]  + \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ \frac{x^n}{n!} a_{n}  \right]  \\
\end{align*}

And hence by applying eqref:eq:exp-gen-def-1, eqref:eq:exp-gen-def-2 and eqref:eq:exp-gen-def-3:

\begin{align}
f''\left( x \right) &= f'\left( x \right)+  f\left( x \right)
\end{align}


Using the theory of higher order linear differential equations with
constant coefficients it can be shown:


\begin{align*}
f\left( x \right)= c_1 \cdot  \mathrm{exp}\left[ \left( \frac{1- \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)x \right] +  c_2 \cdot  \mathrm{exp}\left[ \left( \frac{1 +  \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)x \right]
\end{align*}


By equating this to the power series:


\begin{align*}
f\left( x \right)&= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ \left( c_1\left( \frac{1- \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)^n +  c_2  \left( \frac{1+ \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)^n \right) \cdot  \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]
\end{align*}


Now given that:


\begin{align*}
f\left( x \right)= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]
\end{align*}


We can conclude that:


\begin{align*}
a_n = c_1\cdot  \left( \frac{1- \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)^n +  c_2 \cdot  \left( \frac{1+  \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)^n
\end{align*}


By applying the initial conditions:


\begin{align*}
a_0= c_1 +  c_2  \implies  c_1= - c_2\\
a_1= c_1 \left( \frac{1+ \sqrt{5} }{2} \right) -  c_1 \left( \frac{1-\sqrt{5} }{2} \right)  \implies  c_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5} }\\
\ \\
\therefore ~ c_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, c_2 = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}
\end{align*}


And so finally we have the solution to the /Fibonacci Sequence/ ref:eq:fib-def-shift:


\begin{align}
    a_n &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{5} } \left[ \left( \frac{1+  \sqrt{5} }{2}  \right)^n -  \left( \frac{1- \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)^n \right] \nonumber \\
&= \frac{\varphi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5} } \nonumber\\
&=\frac{\varphi^n -  \psi^n}{\varphi - \psi} \label{eq:fib-sol}
\end{align}


where:

- $\varphi = \frac{1+ \sqrt{5} }{2} \approx 1.61\ldots$
- $\psi = 1-\varphi = \frac{1- \sqrt{5} }{2} \approx 0.61\ldots$

*** Golden Ratio
This closed solution eqref:eq:fib-sol also demonstrates that successive terms of the Fibonacci numbers converge to the Golden Ratio:



\begin{align*}
    F_n &= \frac{\varphi^n-\psi^n}{\varphi-\psi} = \frac{\varphi^n-\psi^n}{\sqrt 5} \\
    \iff \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}	&= \frac{\varphi^{n+ 1} - \psi^{n+  1}}{\varphi^{n} - \psi^{n}} \\
    \iff \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left[ \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} \right]	&= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left[ \frac{\varphi^{n+ 1} - \psi^{n+  1}}{\varphi^{n} - \psi^{n}} \right] \\
&= \frac{\varphi^{n+ 1} -\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left[ \psi^{n +  1} \right] }{\varphi^{n} - \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left[ \psi^n \right] } \\
\text{because $\mid \psi \mid < 0$ $n \rightarrow \infty \implies \psi^{n} \rightarrow 0$:} \\

The distribution of sunflower seeds is an example of the /Fibonacci Sequence/
occurring in a pattern observed in nature (see Figure [[sunflower]]), the distribution of seeds produces a spiral pattern and the number of clockwise and anti-clockwise spirals that emerge tend to be Fibonacci Numbers. cite:bohannonSunflowersShowComplex2016

Although the emergence of the Fibonacci Numbers with respect to the sunflower head and models to explain this emergence is well documented in the literature (see e.g. cite:ridleyPackingEfficiencySunflower1982,mathaiConstructingSunflowerHead1974,vogelBetterWayConstruct1979) these have not been reviewed, rather a simple approach to model this phenomena in a way that can be easily programmed with Turtle Graphics (implemented also in \S [[#turtle]]) has been devised,

Assume that the process a sunflower follows when placing seeds is as follows: [fn:sf]

1. Place a seed
2. Move some small unit away from the origin
3. Rotate some constant angle $\mathtt{\theta}$  from the previous seed (with respect to the origin).
4. Repeat this process until a seed hits some outer boundary.

This process can be simulated in Julia as shown in listing
[[simulate-sunflower]] . When a variety of different angles of rotation are
tried various different patterns emerge, such patterns are shown in Figure [[simulate-sunflower-image]], choosing an angle of \(\varphi\) produces output as shown in Figure [[simulate-sunflower-image]].

A distribution of seeds under this process would be optimal if the amount of empty space was minimized, spirals, stars and swirls contain patterns that compromise this.

#+CAPTION: Optimization of simulated distribution of Sunflower seeds occurs for $\theta =2 \varphi  \pi$ as described in section [[#sunflower-example]] and listing [[simulate-sunflower]]
[[file:media/Outline/golden-flower.svg]]

To minimize this, the proportion of the circle traversed in step 3 must be an
irrational number, however this alone is not sufficient, the decimal values must
also be not to approximated by a rational number, for example
cite:NatureGoldenRatio2018:

+ \(\pi \mod 1 \approx \frac{1}{7}=0.71428571428 \)
+ \(e \mod 1 \approx \frac{5}{7}= 0.142857142857 \)
# 0.7142857142857143
# 0.14285714285714285

It can be seen by simulation that $\phi$ and $\psi$ (because $\phi \mod 1 =
\psi$) are solutions to this optimization problem as shown in Figure
[[simulate-sunflower-phi]], this solution is unstable, a very minor change to the
value will result in patterns re-emerging in the distribution. [fn:sim]

The bottom right spiral in Figure [[simulate-sunflower-image]] has a ratio of rotation of $\frac{1}{\pi}$, the spirals look similar to one direction of the spirals occurring in Figure [[simulate-sunflower-phi]], it is not clear if there is any significance to this similarity.

* Julia Sets                                                                    :Ryan:
** Introduction
Julia sets provide an example of a family of very complex structures that emerge from a very simple mathematical processes.
** Motivation
Consider the iterative process $x \rightarrow x^{2}, \enspace x \in \mathbb{R}$,
for values of $x>1$ this process will diverge and for $x<1$ it will converge.

The iterative process $z \rightarrow z^{2}, \enspace z \in \mathbb{C}$,
for values of $\left\lvert z \right\rvert >1$ diverges and for $\left\lvert z \right\rvert <1$ it will converge, this is visualized in [[py-circle-plot]]

This can be generalized, consider:

- The complex plane for $\left\lvert z \right\rvert \leq 1$
- Some function $f_{c}(z) = z^{2} + c, \quad c \leq 1 \in \mathbb{C}$ that can be used to iterate with

Every value on that plane will belong to one of the two following sets

- $P_{c}$
  + The set of values on the plane that converge to zero (prisoners)
  + Define $Q^{(k)}_{c}$ to be the the set of values confirmed as prisoners after $k$ iterations of $f_{c}$
    - this implies $\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \left[ Q^{(k)}_{c}  \right] = P_{c}$
- $E_{c}$
  + The set of values on the plane that tend to $\infty$ (escapees)

In the case of $f_{0}(z) = z^{2}$ all values $\left\lvert z  \right \rvert \leq 1$ are bounded with $\left\lvert z  \right \rvert = 1$ being an unstable stationary circle, but for different iterative functions like $f_{1}(z) = z^{2} - 1$ the circle of convergence distorts to a fractal pattern, the set of all points on the boundary of convergence is said to be the /Julia Set/ [[cite:peitgenChaosFractalsNew2004][Ch. 14]].

** Plotting the Sets
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       baa21085-5d8f-4390-9bb7-43c3b51d940d
:END:
To implement this test we'll consider a function called ~escape_test~ that applies an
iteration (in this case $f_{0}: z \rightarrow z^{2}$) until that value diverges or converges. [fn:ma]


#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+attr_latex: :width 0.38\textwidth :float wrap
#+NAME: py-jl-1-plot
#+CAPTION: Circle of Convergence for $f_{0}: z \rightarrow z^{2} - 1$
[[file:media/Outline/julia-1.svg]]


While iterating with $f_{c}$ once $\left\lvert z \right\rvert >
\mathrm{max}\left(\left\{c, 2\right\}\right)$, the value must diverge because
\(\left\lvert c \right\rvert \leq 1\), so rather than record whether or not the
value converges or diverges, the ~escape_test~ can instead record the number of
iterations $(k)$ until the value has crossed that boundary and this will provide
a measurement of the rate of divergence.

The ~escape_test~ function can then be mapped over a matrix, where each element
of that matrix is in turn mapped to a point on the Cartesian Plane, the resulting matrix
can be visualized as an image, this is implemented in listing
[[py-circle-code]] and the corresponding output shown in [[py-circle-plot]].

Observe that the absolute value was not used in [[py-circle-code]] (or below in \S
[[#dim-julia]] ), this is because a ~sqrt~ is a costly operation that can be avoided
by comparing two squares, this is important when multiple iterations over large
matrices are required, this accounted for as much as 50% of the time required to
generate the data using listing [[*Definition of a Fractal]] in \S [[#dim-julia]].

The resulting circle in Figure [[py-circle-plot]] is precisely what would be expected, verifying this approach.
Consider now the result if this same procedure was applied to a slightly different function, for example the following functions:

\begin{align*}
f_{1}&: z \rightarrow
z^{2} - 1 \\
f_{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{i}{2}}&: z
\rightarrow z^{2} + (\frac{1}{4} + \frac{i}{2})
\end{align*}

The results are shown in Figures [[py-jl-1-plot]] and [[py-jl-rab-plot]] and are remarkably complex fractals, somewhat unexpected given the simple process,




To investigate this further consider the more general function:

\begin{align}
f_{0.8 e^{\pi i \tau}}: z \rightarrow z^{2} + 0.8 e^{\pi
i \tau}, \enspace \tau \in \mathbb{R}
\end{align}

Many fractals can be generated using
this set by varying the value of $\tau$[fn:wk]. /Julia/ will be used to implement this due to performance constraints. These images can be
generated in /Julia/ in a similar fashion as before, with the specifics shown in
listing [[julia-gen-fracs]]. The ~GR~ package appears to be the best plotting
library performance wise and so was used to save corresponding images to disc,
this is demonstrated in listing [[GR-save]] where 1200 pictures at a 2.25 MP
resolution were produced. [fn:tm]

A subset of these images can be combined using /ImageMagick/ and ~bash~ to
create a collage, /ImageMagick/ can also be used to produce an animation but it often
fails and a superior approach is to use ~ffmpeg~, this is demonstrated in
listing [[bash-frac-join]], the collage is shown in Figure [[montage-frac]].

** Dimension of the Julia Set
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dim-julia
:END:
The Julia Set is defined as the boundary between which values diverge and
converge on the complex plane
[[cite:falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b][\S 14.1]], this means a matrix
representing such a fractal must only have values along this boundary. This can
be achieved by looping over every element of a matrix and replacing each value
with 0 if it is surrounded on all sides values.

To implement this for a boolean matrix a function could consider if immediately
adjacent elements sum to 9, that point should be set to 0 if this is true
because it does not represent a boundary. This is implemented in [[outline-func]]
and although this will not perfectly trace the outline of a fractal like the
/Julia Set/, it is expected that this approach will not introduce bias and so
the impact on accuracy will be constant for /Julia Sets/ across all scales of
resolution.

#+NAME: outline-func
#+CAPTION: A function to set all values of matrix, that do not represent the boundary of a shape, to zero. This is designed for a boolean matrix and works by summing the neighborhood of an element, if that neighborhood is greater than 9 (indicating that all values surrounding the point contain an element), the value is set to 1.
#+begin_src julia
function outline(mat)
    work_mat = copy(mat)
    for col in 2:(size(mat)[2]-1)
        for row in 2:(size(mat)[1]-1)
            ## Make the inside 0, we only want the outline
            neighbourhood = mat[row-1:row+1,col-1:col+1]
            if sum(neighbourhood) >= 9 # 9 squares
                work_mat[row,col] = 0
            end
        end
    end
    return work_mat
end
#+end_src

In order to measure the dimension of the /Julia Set/ it is necessary to generate
a representation of the fractal at two scales, compare them and then
measure the corresponding dimension value as in \S [[#gen-self-sim-frac]]. The julia set
is a non self-similar fractal and so it is not immediately clear whether or not
the dimension will be constant at all scales, to determine whether or not the
dimension is constant at various scales it can be convenient to plot the log
transformed scaling factor and measures and inspect whether or not the points
form a linear relationship, the slope of such a relationship will be the
dimension as discussed in \S [[#sans-self]].

To implement this all the functions necessary to build the fractals were placed
into a separate script ~julia-set-functions.jl~ which is shown in \S
[[julia-set-functions-script]] and this script was included into a working script
~julia-set-dimensions.jl~ by using the following line:

The working script to measure the dimension of the Julia Set is shown in listing
[[dimensions-julia-set]]. This script generates fractals of the /Julia Set/
corresponding to \(z \leftarrow z^{2} -0.123+0.745i\) for a variety of different
scales, at each scale the measure of the fractal is recorded and by running the code in listing [[dimensions-julia-set]]
for scales from 9000 to 10000 and leaving it for an hour, the following
table of values is returned:

| */Scale/*  | */Mass/*  |
|------------+-----------|
|        500 |    4834.0 |
|        563 |    5754.0 |
|        625 |    6640.0 |
|        688 |    7584.0 |
|        750 |    8418.0 |
|        813 |    9550.0 |

|        938 |   11710.0 |
|       1000 |   12744.0 |


Using this technique the dimension of the Julia Set converges very slowly and
the code can take a very long time to run, and has a tendency to cause crashes,
likely due to the large amounts of memory required, the values produced took
about one hour to produce.

Linear Regression can be performed against these values using */R/* [fn:: The could just as well have been done inside Julia, */R/* was chosen simply because ~ggplot~ produces very nice plots. ]

#+begin_src R
scale   <- c(500, 563, 625, 688, 750, 813, 875, 938, 1000)
measure <- c(  4834, 5754, 6640, 7584, 8418, 9550, 10554, 11710, 12744)
data <- data.frame(scale, measure)

Inspecting the behavior of the log transformed scale and measure in Figure
[[fig:lin-reg-dim]] indicates that there is a very linear relationship between these
variables and so even though this julia set does not appear to demonstrate
simple self-similarity, it appears to be a figure with a constant dimension
across scales.

Investigating the Julia Set in Figure [[montage-frac]], a natural question arises, /which values of \(c\)
produce a fractal that is an open disc or a closed disc/. If an arbitrary complex value $\left\lvert \gamma \right \rvert < 1$
is chosen to produce the julia set $f_{\gamma}$, that value is said to belong to the Mandelbrot set if the corresponding /Julia Set/ is a closed disc [[cite:peitgenChaosFractalsNew2004][Ch. 14]].
$P$ is closed we this value is defined as belonging to the /Mandelbrot/ set.

It can be shown, that a value \(z_{0}\) is interior to the /Mandelbrot Set/ if \(f_{z_{0}}\) is interior to the julia set and hence this problem is equivalent to re-implementing the previous strategy such that $z \rightarrow z^{2} + z_{0}$ where $z_{0}$ is unchanging or more clearly as a sequence:

\begin{align}
z_{n+1} &= z^{2}_n + c \label{eq:mb-sequence} \\
z_{0}   &= c
\end{align}

This strategy is implemented in listing [[py-pandelbrot-code]] and produces the output shown in Figure [[mandelbrot-py-pic]].

The dimension of the mandelbrot set is 2 cite:bownScienceMandelbrotSet and can be measured using the exact same strategy as \S [[#dim-julia]]. [fn:cm] The Mandelbrot set is extraordinarily complex and actually contains many of the patterns of various Julia Sets within it [[cite:peitgenChaosFractalsNew2004][Ch. 14]].
* Conclusion                                                                  
Fractals are complex shapes that may or may not exhibit self similarity and often arise from natural phenomena. They are hard to define in a way that captures all potential edge cases. One important feature of fractals is the dimension of the complex shape, they are not simple finite shapes and so there dimension is usually higher than what might be anticipated by considering the corresponding the dimension of a shape that may approximate the general figure.

This concept of dimension can be extended to shapes that do not exhibit clear self-similarity by using linear regression, this includes particularly complex fractals such as the Mandelbrot Set.

Simple processes that involve recursion can lead to the emergence of patterns that are fractals, these fractals can often include other characteristic properties that involve values such as the golden ratio and Fibonacci Numbers.

This can be shown for all derivatives by way of induction, for

\begin{align}
f^{(k)}\left(x\right) = \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot x^n}{n!} \quad \text{for}~k \ge 0
\end{align}

Assume that $f^{(k)}\left(x\right) = \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot x^n}{n!}$

Using this assumption, prove for the next element $k+1$

We need $f^{(k+1)}(x) = \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k+1}\cdot x^n}{n!}$

\begin{align*}
    \text{LHS} &= f^{(k+1)}(x)\\
    &= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(f^{(k)}(x)\right)\\
    &= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(\sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot x^n}{n!}\right)\quad \text{by assumption}\\
    &= \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot n\cdot x^{n-1}}{n!}\\
    &= \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}\\
    &= \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k+1}\cdot x^{n}}{n!}\\
    &= \text{RHS}
\end{align*}

Therefore, by mathematical induction $f^{(k)}\left(x\right) = \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot x^n}{n!} \quad \text{for}~k \ge 0$

Furthermore, if the first derivative of the exponential generating function shown in eqref:eq:exp-pow-series-sol
shifts the sequence across, then every derivative thereafter does so as well.

An equation of the form:

\begin{align}
\sum^{n}_{i=0} \left[ c_{i} \cdot f^{(i)}(x) \right] = 0 \label{eq:hom-ode}
\end{align}

is said to be a homogeneous linear ODE: [[cite:zillDifferentialEquations2009a][Ch. 2]]

- Linear :: because the equation is linear with respect to $f(x)$
- Ordinary :: because there are no partial derivatives (e.g. $\frac{\partial }{\partial x}{\left({ f{\left({ x }\right)} }\right)}$  )
- Differential :: because the derivatives of the function are concerned
- Homogeneous :: because the */RHS/* is 0
  - A non-homogeneous equation would have a non-zero RHS

There will be $k$ solutions to a $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ order linear ODE, each may be summed to produce a superposition which will also be a solution to the equation, [[cite:zillDifferentialEquations2009a][Ch. 4]]  this will be considered as the desired complete solution (and this will be shown to be the only solution for the recurrence relation eqref:eq:recurrence-relation-def. These $k$ solutions will be in one of two forms:

1. $f(x)=c_{i} \cdot e^{m_{i}x}$
2. $f(x)=c_{i} \cdot x^{j}\cdot e^{m_{i}x}$

where:

- $\sum^{k}_{i=0}\left[  c_{i}m^{k-i} \right] = 0$
  - This is referred to the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation or ODE cite:levinSolvingRecurrenceRelations2018

  - These are often referred to as repeated roots cite:levinSolvingRecurrenceRelations2018,zillMatrixExponential2009 with a multiplicity corresponding to the number of repetitions of that root [[cite:nicodemiIntroductionAbstractAlgebra2007][\textsection 3.2]]

    \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}    \sum^{k}_{i= 0}    \frac{x^n}{n!} c_i a_n    &= 0 \\
        \sum^{k}_{i= 0} c_i \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}    \frac{x^n}{n!}  a_n    &= 0
\end{align}

By implementing the exponential generating function as shown in
eqref:eq:exp-gen-def-1, this provides:

\begin{align}
   \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   \left[ c_i f^{\left( i \right)}\left( x \right) \right]
\end{align}


Now assume that the solution exists and all roots of the characteristic polynomial are unique (i.e. the solution is of the form $f{\left({ x }\right)} \propto e^{m_i x}: \quad m_i \neq m_j \forall i\neq j$), this implies that  [[cite:zillDifferentialEquations2009a][Ch. 4]] :

\begin{align}
    f{\left({ x }\right)} = \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ k_i e^{m_i x} }\right]}, \quad \exists m,k \in \mathbb{C} \nonumber
\end{align}

This can be re-expressed in terms of the exponential power series, in order to relate the solution of the function $f{\left({ x }\right)}$ back to a solution of the sequence $a_n$, (see section [[#prove-exp-power-series]] for a derivation of the exponential power series

\begin{align}
    \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ k_i e^{m_i x}  }\right]}  &= \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ k_i \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \frac{{\left({ m_i x }\right)}^n}{n!}  }\right]}  \nonumber \\

							 &=    \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0} \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   k_i m_i^n \frac{x^n}{n!} \nonumber \\
							 &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0} {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!}  \sum^{k}_{i=0}   {\left[{ k_im^n_i }\right]}  }\right]}, \quad \exists k_i \in \mathbb{C}, \enspace \forall i \in \mathbb{Z}^+\cap {\left[{ 1, k }\right]}     \label{eq:unique-root-sol-power-series-form}
\end{align}


Recall the definition of the generating function from eqref:eq:exp-gen-def-1, by equating this to eqref:eq:unique-root-sol-power-series-form:

\begin{align}
    f{\left({ x }\right)} &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{  \frac{x^n}{n!} a_n }\right]} \nonumber \\
&= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0} {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!}  \sum^{k}_{i=0}   {\left[{ k_im^n_i }\right]}  }\right]}  \nonumber \\
      \implies  a_n &= \sum^{k}_{n= 0} {\left[{ k_im_i^n }\right]}     \nonumber \\ \nonumber
\square
\end{align}

This can be verified by the Fibonacci sequence as shown in section [[#solving-the-sequence]], the solution to the characteristic equation is $m_1 = \varphi, m_2 = {\left({ 1-\varphi }\right)}$ and the corresponding solution to the linear ODE and recursive relation are:

\begin{alignat}{4}
    f{\left({ x }\right)} &= &c_1 e^{\varphi x} +  &c_2 e^{{\left({ 1-\varphi }\right)} x}, \quad &\exists c_1, c_2 \in \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C} \nonumber \\
    \iff  a_n &= &k_1 n^{\varphi} +  &k_2 n^{1- \varphi}, &\exists k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C} \nonumber
\end{alignat}

Consider the following recurrence relation:

\begin{align}
    a_{n+2} -  10a_{n+ 1} +  25a_{n}&= 0 \label{eq:hom-repeated-roots-recurrence} \\
    \implies  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ a_{n+2} \frac{x^n}{n!} }\right]} - 10 \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ a_{n+1} \frac{x^n}{n!}    }\right]} + 25 \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0 }   {\left[{  a_{n}\frac{x^n}{n!} }\right]}&= 0 \nonumber
\end{align}

By applying the definition of the exponential generating function at eqref:eq:exp-gen-def-1 :

\begin{align}
    f''{\left({ x }\right)}- 10f'{\left({ x }\right)}+  25f{\left({ x }\right)}= 0 \label{eq:rep-roots-func-ode}
\end{align}

By implementing the already well-established theory of linear ODE's, the
characteristic equation for eqref:eq:rep-roots-func-ode can be expressed as:

\begin{align}
    m^2- 10m+  25 = 0 \nonumber \\
    {\left({ m- 5 }\right)}^2 = 0 \nonumber \\
    m= 5 \label{eq:rep-roots-recurrence-char-sol}
\end{align}

Herein lies a complexity, in order to solve this, the solution produced from eqref:eq:rep-roots-recurrence-char-sol can be used with the /Reduction of Order/ technique to produce a solution that will be of the form [[cite:zillMatrixExponential2009][\textsection 4.3]].

\begin{align}
    f{\left({ x }\right)}= c_1e^{5x} +  c_2 x e^{5x} \label{eq:rep-roots-ode-sol}
\end{align}

eqref:eq:rep-roots-ode-sol can be expressed in terms of the exponential power series in order to try and relate the solution for the function back to the generating function,
observe however the following power series identity [fn:ps] (proof in section [[#prove-general-exp-identity]]):

\begin{align}
    x^ke^x &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= k}   {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{{\left({ n- k }\right)}!} }\right]}, \quad \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \label{eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident}
\end{align}

by applying identity eqref:eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident to equation eqref:eq:rep-roots-ode-sol

\begin{align}
    \implies  f{\left({ x }\right)} &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ c_1 \frac{{\left({ 5x }\right)}^n}{n!} }\right]}  +  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 1}   {\left[{ c_2 n \frac{{\left({ 5x }\right)^n}}{n{\left({ n-1 }\right)}!} }\right]} \nonumber \\
 &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!} {\left({ c_{1}5^n +  c_2 n 5^n   }\right)} }\right]} \nonumber
\end{align}

Given the definition of the exponential generating function from eqref:eq:exp-gen-def-1

\begin{align}
    f{\left({ x }\right)}&=     \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} }\right]} \nonumber \\
    \iff a_n &= c_{1}5^n +  c_{2}5^n \nonumber \\ \nonumber
    \ \nonumber \\
    \square \nonumber
\end{align}

****** Proof
Consider a recurrence relation of the form:

\begin{align}
     \sum^{k}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ c_i a_n }\right]}  = 0 \nonumber \\
      \implies  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   c_i a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} = 0 \nonumber \\
      \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   c_i a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} \nonumber
\end{align}

By substituting for the value of the generating function from eqref:eq:exp-gen-def-1:

\begin{align}
    \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ c_if^{{\left({ k }\right)}}  {\left({ x }\right)}    }\right]} \label{eq:gen-form-rep-roots-ode}
\end{align}

Assume that eqref:eq:gen-form-rep-roots-ode corresponds to a characteristic polynomial with only 1 root of multiplicity $k$, the solution would hence be of the form:

\begin{align}
			 & \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ c_i m^i }\right]} = 0 \wedge m=B, \enspace  \exists! B \in \mathbb{C} \nonumber \\
 \implies      f{\left({ x }\right)}&= \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ x^i A_i e^{mx} }\right]}, \quad \exists A \in \mathbb{C}^+, \enspace \forall i \in {\left[{ 1,k }\right]} \cap \mathbb{N}  \label{eq:sol-rep-roots-ode}
\end{align}

By implementing the identity first introduced at eqref:eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident (this is proved in \S [[#prove-general-exp-identity]]):

\begin{align}
x^k e^x = \sum^{\infty}_{n= k} {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{{\left({ n- k }\right)}!} }\right]}  \label{eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident-used}%  \tag{\eqref{eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident}\textsuperscript{2}}
\end{align}

See section [[#prove-general-exp-identity]] for proof.

We can apply identity eqref:eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident to eqref:eq:sol-rep-roots-ode, which gives:

\begin{align}
f{\left({ x }\right)}&=     \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ A_i \sum^{\infty}_{n= i}   {\left[{ \frac{{\left({ x m }\right)}^n}{{\left({ n- i }\right)}!} }\right]}  }\right]} \nonumber \\
&=     \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ \sum^{k}_{i=0} {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!}  \frac{n!}{{\left({ n- i }\right)!}} A_i m^n }\right]}       }\right]} \nonumber \\
&=     \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0} {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!}   \sum^{k}_{i=0} {\left[{  \frac{n!}{{\left({ n- i }\right)!}} A_i m^n }\right]}       }\right]} \nonumber
\end{align}

Recall the generating function that was used to get eqref:eq:gen-form-rep-roots-ode:

\begin{align}
f{\left({ x }\right)}&= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} }\right]}      \nonumber \\
 \implies  a_n &= \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ A_i \frac{n!}{{\left({ n- i }\right)}!} m^n  }\right]} \nonumber \\

******* Motivation                                                        :James:

Consider the function $f(x) = xe^x$. Using the Taylor series formula we get the following:

\begin{align*}
    xe^x &= 0+\frac{1}{1!}x+\frac{2}{2!}x^2+\frac{3}{3!}x^3+\frac{4}{4!}x^4+\frac{5}{5!}x^5+\dots\\
    &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{nx^n}{n!}\\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{(n-1)!}
\end{align*}

Similarly, $f(x) = x^2e^x$ will give:
\begin{align*}
    x^2e^x &= \frac{0}{0!} + \frac{0x}{1!} + \frac{2x^2}{2!} + \frac{6x^3}{3!} + \frac{12x^4}{4!} + \frac{20x^5}{5!} + \dots\\
    &= \frac{2\cdot 1x^2}{2!} + \frac{3\cdot 2 x^3}{3!} + \frac{4\cdot 3x^4}{4!} + \frac{5\cdot 4 x^5}{5!} + \dots\\
    &= \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n(n-1)x^n}{n!}\\
    &= \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{x^n}{(n-2)!}
\end{align*}

We conjecture that If we continue this on, we get:

\begin{align*}
    x^ke^x = \sum_{n=k}^\infty \frac{x^n}{(n-k)!} \quad \text{for}~k\in \mathbb{Z^{+}}\cap0
\end{align*}
******* Proof by Induction                                                :James:
To verify, let's prove this by induction.
******** Base
Test $k=0$
\begin{align*}
    LHS &= x^0e^x = e^x\\
    RHS &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} = e^x\\
\end{align*}
Therefore LHS = RHS, so $k=0$ is true

******** Bridge
Assume $x^k e^x = \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{x^n}{(n-k)!}$

Using this assumption, prove for the next element $k+1$\\

We need $x^{k+1}e^x = \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{x^n}{(n-(k+1))!}$

\begin{align*}
    \text{LHS} &= x^{k+1}e^x\\
    &= x\cdot x^{k}e^x\\
    &= x\cdot \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{x^n}{(n-k)!} \quad \text{(by assumption)}\\
    &= \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n-k)!}\\
    &= \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{x^n}{(n-1-k)!} \quad \text{(re-indexing}~ n\text{)}\\
    &= \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{x^n}{(n-(k+1))!}\\
    &= RHS
\end{align*}
So by mathematical induction $f(x) = x^ke^x = \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{x^n}{(n-k)!}$ \text{for} $k \ge 0$

Moving on, by applying identity eqref:eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident to equation eqref:eq:rep-roots-ode-sol

******* Establishing the Proof                                            :Ryan:
We make the assumption that \(\left( x \right)! = \Gamma\left( x \right) \forall x \in \mathbb{R}\), If it can be shown that \(\frac{1}{\Gamma\left( x \right)} = 0 \enspace \forall x \in \mathbb{R} < 0\) then observe the following:

\begin{align}
    \sum^{k- 1}_{n= 0}   \left[ \frac{x^n}{\left( n- x \right)!} \right] &= \sum^{k- 1}_{n= 0}   \left[ \frac{1}{\Gamma\left( n- k \right)} \cdot  x^{n} \right]  \\
    \intertext{because \(n- k < 0 \enspace \forall n \in \left[ 0, n- k \right] \)}: \notag \\
    &= \sum^{k- 1}_{n= 0}   \left[ 0\times x^n \right]  \\
    &= 0
\end{align}

and hence:

\begin{align}
    \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ \frac{x^n}{\left( n- x \right)!} \right]  &= \sum^{k-1}_{n= 0}   \left[ \frac{x^{n}}{\Gamma\left( n- x \right)} \right]  +  \sum^{\infty}_{n= k}   \left[ \frac{x^{n}}{\left( n- x \right)!} \right] \\
    &= 0 +    \sum^{\infty}_{n= k}   \left[ \frac{x^{n}}{\left( n- x \right)!} \right] \\
    \intertext{From the inductive proof before:} \notag \\
    &= x^{k}e^{x}
\end{align}

******* TODO Divergence of the Gamma Function                             :James:

\begin{align}
\Gamma (-p) &= \int_0^\infty t^{-p-1}e^{-t}\mathrm{d}t \quad , p \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\\
&= \int_0^1 \frac{1}{t^{p+1}e^t} \mathrm{d}t + \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{t^{p+1}e^t} \mathrm{d}t
\end{align}

Consider the integral

\begin{align}
I = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{t^{p+1}} \mathrm{d}t &= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_a^1 \frac{1}{t^{p+1}} \mathrm{d}t\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left[ \frac{t^{-(p+1)}}{-(p+1)+1} \right]_a^1\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left[ \frac{-t^{-(p+1)}}{p} \right]_a^1\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left[ \frac{-1}{p} + \frac{1}{a^{p+1}p} \right]\\
&= \frac{-1}{p} + \lim_{a \to 0^+}\frac{1}{a^{p+1}p}\\
&= \frac{-1}{p} + \infty\\
&= \infty
\end{align}

Since $I$ diverges, $$\int_0^1 \frac{1}{t^{p+1}e^t} \mathrm{d}t$$ also diverges by integral comparison test.
And likewise, consider the integral:

\begin{align}
J = \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{e^t}\mathrm{d}t &= \lim_{a \to \infty} \int_1^a e^{-t}dt\\
&= \lim_{a \to \infty} \left[ -e^{-t} \right]_1^a\\
&= \lim_{a \to \infty} \left[ \frac{-1}{e^a} + \frac{1}{e} \right]\\
&= 0 + \frac{1}{e}\\
&= \frac{1}{e}
\end{align}

Since $J$ converges, $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{t^{p+1}e^t}\mathrm{d}t$ also converges by the integral comparison test
Hence,

\begin{align}
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{t^{p+1}e^t} \mathrm{d}t + \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{t^{p+1}e^t} \mathrm{d}t &= \infty + \frac{1}{e}\\
&= \infty
\end{align}

i.e. $\Gamma(-p)$ diverges for $p \in \mathbb{Z}^+$

In sections [[#uniq-roots-recurrence]] and [[#rep-roots-recurrence]]
it was shown that a recurrence relation can be related to an ODE and then that
solution can be transformed to provide a solution for the recurrence relation.
This was shown in two separate cases, one with unique roots and the other with
repeated roots. However, in many circumstances the solutions to the characteristics
equation are a combination of both unique and repeated roots. Hence, in general the
solution to a linear ODE will be a superposition of solutions for each root, repeated
or unique and so a goal of our research will be to put this together to find a general
solution for homogeneous linear recurrence relations.

Sketching out an approach for this:

- Use the Generating function to get an ODE
- The ODE will have a solution that is a combination of the above two forms
- The solution will translate back to a combination of both above forms
